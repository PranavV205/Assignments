        "\n",
        "Shortcomings of SOAP:\n",
        "1. As SOAP can only transfer messages as XML files, your SOAP API will be less performant, as XML is a verbose format compared to others. API calls made to your server will need more bandwidth and it will take more time to process the request and transfer the response back to the client\n",
        "2. In SOAP, the client-server communication depends on WSDL (Web Service Description Language) contracts, which implies tight coupling. Therefore, it’s not recommended for loosely coupled applications as you can’t opt out of using a contract between the client and the server.\n",
        "3. SOAP also has a higher learning curve, is harder to code, and can’t be tested in the web browser (as opposed to REST). With SOAP, you need to generate contracts in WSDL, create client stubs, follow strict specifications, and more. This also means that as a programmer, you’ll also have less freedom of choice."
